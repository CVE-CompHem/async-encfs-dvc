# A generic preprocessing stage converting external input data to internal format
# All values are interpreted as paths relative to the host/container data (encfs) mount point
# Make sure that folders in input/original/<dataset-name/version/stage> are 'dvc add'-ed if not output of a dvc stage.
# Subsequent DVC stages may only depend on dvc-added folders/files or their subdirectories.
# Can be used both for a command-line stage and a stage run outside of DVC (e.g. in a GUI, cf. app_prep)
